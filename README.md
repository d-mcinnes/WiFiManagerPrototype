Interface Prototype
========

This is the early prototype for the UI elements.

Colour Scheme and Text
-----

If you want to change the colour scheme, just go to res/values/colors.xml. The rest should be pretty self explanatory.

If anyone wants to change any of the text (like the descriptions or something), use the res/values/strings.xml file. Again, rest should be pretty self explanatory.
